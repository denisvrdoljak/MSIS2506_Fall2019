# ML Lab

## Scoring:
* If you attempt this entire lab, you will get full credit.
* If you correctly train a machine learning model, you will get extra credit.
* If you beat the results posted in the reference repo, you will get more extra credit!

## Assignment:
Using the R machine learnign demo as a reference, create a Naive Bayes model using the breast cancer dataset hosted here:

Note, the column names are not part of the csv file. You will have to add them manually from the field_names.txt file.

Note 2, the ID field should be dropped for any ML model.

Note 3, the diagnosis will need to be comverted to a numerical (or factor).
